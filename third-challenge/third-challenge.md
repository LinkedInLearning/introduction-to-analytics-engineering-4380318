# third-challenge

For your last challenge, youâ€™re going to write some documentation surrounding your data model. Please try to include:

Purpose of the data table
What each individual column means
Why/what changes were made in the second project.

There is no specific formatting required here (you'll find some companies may differ here), but it is key to make sure you include all the necessary content!

For this purpose of this exercise, this also does not need to be very long.
