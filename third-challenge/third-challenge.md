# third-challenge

For this challenge, you can either add your own solution from the first chapter or use the first-solution-challenge.sql already in this repo. The solution here in this case will be a branch called second-challenge-solution, so when you are ready you can switch to that branch and check out the pull requests there. The second-challenge-solution.sql will have the full solution.
